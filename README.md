# ROS2_VISION_KIT

Ros2 Vision Kit consists of packages to interface **ROS** with **OpenCV** and a library of Vision-based Algorithms that provide state of the art Detection, Segmentation and Tracking. Its main purpose is to provide Real-Time operations for ROS. 

* [`vision_bridge`](vision-bridge) : A bridge between ROS 2 image messages and OpenCV image representation.
* [`image_geometry`](image-geometry) : Collection of methods for dealing with image and pixel geometry.
* [`ros2_vision_kit`](ros2-vision-kit) : A ROS meta-packege, used for grouping all loose packeges together. In this case, **Vision_Bridge** & **Image_Geometry**
